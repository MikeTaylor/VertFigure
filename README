This directory contains the source code for generating
birfurcatograms, visually similar to Wedel (2009:supp. fig. 1):
https://svpow.files.wordpress.com/2009/02/wedel-2009-supplementary-fig-1.jpg

Input is in VCD (Vertebral Column Description) format.
One such input (the one we need for this project) is bifurcation.vcd

These files are translated into SVG by the vcd2svg script.
This is written in Perl, using the SVG library.

Creation of the output file is controlled by the Makefile.
