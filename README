This project contains vcd2svg, a program for generating schematic
illustrations of vertebral columns, visually similar to that of
Wedel (2009:supplementary figure 1):

It was first written to make Wedel and Taylor (2013a: figure 9):

Input is in the VCD (Vertebral Column Description) format, which is
defined for the first time in this project (but not yet documented).
One such input (the one we used for the 2013 paper) is bifurcation.vcd

These files are translated into SVG by the vcd2svg script.
This is written in Perl, using the SVG library.

Creation of the output file is controlled by the Makefile.
